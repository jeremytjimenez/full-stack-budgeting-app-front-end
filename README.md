In order to see the index, you have to click on the budgtr logo. To create a new transaction, click the Create Transaction text. To see the individual transactions, click on either the date, item, or amount. From there, you can either edit or delete the transaction or press the back button to return to the original index.

On the edit transaction page, there is a checkbox named withdrawal. If it is checked, the numbers you type in will automatically become negative, otherwise they will be positive.
